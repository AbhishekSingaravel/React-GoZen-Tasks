#React
1. Basic Component Creation:
Task: Create a simple React component, such as a button or a text input field.
Requirements: Ensure that the component renders without errors and displays some basic content.
Demonstrate your understanding of JSX syntax and how to define and export functional or class
components in React.
2. State Management:
Task: Create a component that manages its state, such as a counter or a toggle button.
Requirements: Update the component's state based on user interactions, like button clicks or input
changes. Show proficiency in using useState hook or setState method to manage component state.
3. Conditional Rendering:
Task: Create a component that conditionally renders different content based on its state or props.
Requirements: Display different messages or elements depending on certain conditions.
Demonstrate understanding of conditional rendering techniques using if statements, ternary
operators, or logical && operator.
4. Forms and Controlled Components:
Task: Build a form using controlled components.
Requirements: Create input fields for various data types (text, number, etc.), and update the
component's state as the user inputs data. Handle form submission and validation.
5. Component Composition:
Task: Create a higher-order component (HOC) or a render prop component that encapsulates some
functionality.
Requirements: Ensure that the component is reusable and allows other components to leverage its
functionality. Demonstrate understanding of component composition patterns like HOCs, render
props, or using React hooks for code reuse.
6. Lifecycle Methods or useEffect Hook:
Task: Create a component that utilizes lifecycle methods or the useEffect hook for managing side
effects.
Requirements: Demonstrate proper initialization, updating, and cleanup procedures. Understand the
purpose of lifecycle methods or the useEffect hook and know when to use them.
7. Routing with React Router:
Task: Create a multi-page( 3 pages ) application using React Router.
Requirements: Implement multiple routes, each rendering different components, and allow
navigation between these routes. Demonstrate understanding of route configuration, nested routes,
and programmatic navigation.
8. State Lift-Up and Props Drilling:
Task: Refactor a component hierarchy to lift up state or avoid excessive props drilling.
Requirements: Restructure the components to optimize state management and improve component
reusability. Understand how to pass data between components using props and when to lift state to a
common ancestor component.
9. Context API or Redux Integration:
Task: Integrate either the Context API or Redux for state management in a larger application.
Requirements: Demonstrate understanding of global state management and implement actions,
reducers, and dispatchers accordingly. Set up the chosen state management solution, define actions
and reducers, and connect components to the global state.
10. Advanced UI and Performance Optimization:
Task: Optimize the performance of a React application by implementing techniques like memoization,
lazy loading, or virtualization.
Requirements: Identify performance bottlenecks and apply appropriate optimizations to improve the
application's responsiveness and efficiency. Demonstrate understanding of React performance
optimization techniques such as memoization with useMemo or useCallback, lazy loading of
components or data, and virtualization for large lists
11. Error Boundary Implementation:
Task: Implement an error boundary component in a React application.
Requirements: Create a component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component
tree and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application. Demonstrate understanding
of error boundary concepts and how to use them effectively.
12. Authentication and Protected Routes:
Task: Create an authentication system with protected routes in a React application.
Requirements: Implement user authentication using JWT tokens or sessions, and create protected
routes that require authentication to access. Show understanding of authentication flow, storing
tokens securely, and redirecting users based on authentication status.
13. Optimistic UI Updates:
Task: Implement optimistic UI updates in a React application.
Requirements: Design a feature that updates the UI optimistically before receiving confirmation from
the server. Show understanding of handling asynchronous actions, updating UI state optimistically,
and reverting changes if the server request fails.
14. RequirementsCode Splitting and Lazy Loading:
Task: Implement code splitting and lazy loading in a React application.
Requirements: Split the application code into smaller chunks and dynamically load them only when
needed, improving initial page load performance. Show understanding of React.lazy() and Suspense
for lazy loading components, as well as React Router's support for code splitting with dynamic
imports.
